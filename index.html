              <div class="text">
                <p>While deeply opposing some socialist states in real life, he was a democratic socialist himself and deeply opposed totalitarianism and authoritarianism. 
He fought in the spanish civil war on the socialist side, but when he saw the distortion the press was doing in favor of the socialists, he was dramatically affected.
George Orwell, or Eric Arthur Blair, was mainly characterized by his social critiques and commentary and his books, Nineteen Eighty-Four, Animal Farm, The Road to Wigan Pier, and Homage to Catalonia.</p>

              <div class="text">
                <p>Nineteen Eighty-four is a very complex book, about a man as he tries to rebel against an authoritarian government, while also working for said government. As the protagonist makes allies and foes, he starts to rebel against the regime more and more publicly. </p>

              <div class="text">
                <p>While there are many themes in Nineteen Eighty-Four, the most important (subjectively) is the extreme poverty and inequality shown throughout the entire book. Even though the party says that life was better now more so than then, it is not shown that way, with the proles living in hunger, thirst, disease, filth, while the leaders at the top live in grandeur.

Another prevalent theme is the surveillance, which is also omnipresent in the book. The upper and middle classes all have telescreens to be watched and observed with. Citizens are so tightly controlled, that even the slightest sign of doubt can lead to death.

              <div class="title">The Protagonist: Winston</div>
              <div class="text">
                <p>The main protagonist, Winston Smith, is a curious yet relatable character to most. Winston works at the ministry of truth, an organisation dedicated to rewriting history and the past to fit what the party would prefer. He starts to show signs of rebellion, which reaches a high when he meets Julia, another protagonist, who is also against the party. Eventually, they find someone who they think is a member of the brotherhood, an anti-party group, but it turns out that he is a spy for the government and the party.</p>

              <div class="text">
                <p>Would I recommend this book to you, the reader? Probably yes, but depending on who the reader is, no. The book can be very graphic in its description, and while I think that the message is very important and reading it is a good thing for most people, I think it can also be too much for people who are sensitive to that kind of thing. It features scenes of torture and scenes which are not safe to describe in this acedemic context. If you are not sensitive, I would recommend this book.</p>
